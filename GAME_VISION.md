# OilLeak: The Fever Dream of Gulf Activism
## A Game About Futility, Corporate Absurdity, and Trying Anyway

---

## The Origin Story
In April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, killing 11 workers and beginning an 87-day hemorrhage of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. 210 million gallons.

Watching from California, one person couldn't just watch. They drove to Louisiana with a car full of oil sponges, organized thousands through "Save The Gulf" on Facebook, met with Jefferson Parish officials, appeared on WDSU, and spent $10,000 of their own money trying to help.

It didn't stop the oil. Nothing did. But they tried.

This game is that fever dream - one small boat against an endless corporate disaster.

## Core Vision: "Depressingly Fun"
**Genre**: Futility Simulator / Tower Defense (but you always lose) / Dark Satire

**The Hook**: "How long can you hold back the inevitable?"

**The Message**: Sometimes all we can do is try. Sometimes that's enough. Sometimes it's not. Both are true.

---

## Core Gameplay Loop

### The Sisyphean Cycle
1. **Oil erupts** from the ocean floor (endless, increasing)
2. **You throw objects** to temporarily block it (physics-based)
3. **Some oil always escapes** (the futility)
4. **Corporate news ticker** mocks your efforts
5. **You persist anyway** (the human spirit)
6. **Eventually overwhelmed** (the truth)
7. **Score your effort**, not success
8. **Try again** (because what else can we do?)

### The Beautiful Futility
- **YOU CANNOT WIN** - This is essential
- You can only delay, mitigate, try
- High score = "Gallons Delayed" not "Gallons Stopped"
- Every session ends with reality: "The real spill: 210,000,000 gallons"

## Progression of Absurdity

### Item Evolution (Escalating Desperation)
**Wave 1 - Honest Attempts**
- Oil sponges (the actual activism)
- Sandbags
- Barriers

**Wave 2 - BP's Actual "Solutions"**
- Golf balls (Operation "Junk Shot" - real)
- Mud ("Top Kill" - real)
- Rubber pieces
- Metal scraps

**Wave 3 - Corporate Nonsense**
- Dollar bills
- Corporate logos
- PR statements (physical objects)
- Stock certificates

**Wave 4 - Societal Breakdown**
- Thoughts & prayers (ultimate weapon - does nothing)
- Angry tweets
- Protest signs
- Congressional subpoenas

**Wave 5 - Fever Dream**
- Kitchen sinks
- Rubber ducks
- The actual BP CEO
- The concept of accountability

## The Dark Comedy Elements

### News Ticker (Top of Screen)
Scrolling corporate dystopia while you play:
- "Day 47: BP stock price recovers!"
- "CEO: 'I want my life back'"
- "Congress: 'Deeply concerned'"
- "Oil plume visible from space"
- "BP announces record profits"
- "Wildlife rescue efforts 'progressing'"
- "Local fishing industry 'adapting'"

### Environmental Storytelling
- **Wildlife** occasionally swims by, gets oiled, disappears
- **Corporate boats** pass doing nothing
- **News helicopters** circle uselessly
- **Your resources** dwindle (but oil never does)

## Scoring & Progression

### Grades (Not on Success, but Effort)
- **F**: "You tried as hard as BP" (instant quit)
- **D**: "Slightly better than Congress"
- **C**: "Average citizen effort"
- **B**: "Actual activist"
- **A**: "You cared more than everyone"
- **S**: "Still couldn't stop it though"

- "I tried harder than Congress! #OilLeak"
- "Thoughts & prayers didn't work in #OilLeak either"

## The Meta Message

This isn't just a game about the Gulf oil spill. It's about:
- Individual action vs corporate power
- The absurdity of "solutions" to systemic problems
- The importance of trying even when you can't win
- How activism feels in the moment - desperate, vital, futile, necessary

**The player should feel**:
1. Amused (at the absurdity)
2. Frustrated (at the futility)
3. Determined (to try anyway)
4. Reflective (about real-world parallels)

## Development Philosophy

### Ship It Imperfect
Like driving to Louisiana with sponges - imperfect action beats perfect inaction.

### Authenticity > Polish
Raw truth over refined lies.

### The Try Matters
The game can't win against oil.
The player can't win against the leak.
The activism couldn't stop BP.
We try anyway.

That's the point.
